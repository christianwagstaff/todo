Using NPM and vanilla JS, this is a web app were users  can create items, set priorities, mark as completed, delete and create custom projects to group items together.

The user data is stored in Local Storage to persist between sessions. There is a quick localStorage erase button on the top right of the screen, to allow users to easily remove their data if desired.

For future versions, the data can be stored using a backend database. For this to be done, the front end will need to be redone to parse the data differently.
